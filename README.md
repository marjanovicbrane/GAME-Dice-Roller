# About the game:

This is a multiplayer game, first plays player 1.This game generates random number between 1-6 while you rolling the dice.Who gets 100 points first, he is the winner.

When you press the button “ROLL DICE”, you roll the dice and your current score field show you how many points do you have.While you rolling the dice all points are summed together.
When you press the button “HOLD”, you hold that current score and that current score becomes total score and then plays player 2.

Tricky part in this game is, when you get number 1 while you rolling the dice, all current score that you collect is set to 0, you also lose the move in the game and then plays player 2.

If you want to play the game again, you need to press the button “NEW GAME”.
